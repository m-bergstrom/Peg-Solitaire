== Overview

link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peg_solitaire[Peg solitaire] is a 1-player board game in which the user attempts to eliminate all but one marker (usually a peg or marble) from the board.
The player does so by successively "jumping" a marker over an adjacent marker to a vacant space on the board to eliminate the over-jumped marker. All variants of this implementation share these features:

Basic gameplay:: Jumping and elimination, win and loss detection, _etc_.
Time tracking:: Tracks the start and times for each game.
Undo / redo:: The player can undo and redo moves.

[IMPORTANT]
While included in the solution, the PegSolitaire project doesn't implement the game yet. *Start with PegSolitaire.App instead.*

== TO DO

Peg Solitaire is an ongoing work in progress. Here are some of the next things on my to-do list:

* Implement more board shapes (_e.g._, hexagon, cross)
* Implement PegSolitaire--the online, Blazor Server, variant that saves game stats by player to support leader boards, _etc_.
* Implement a reasonably performant hint system
* Rename from Peg Solitaire to Marble Solitaire since marbles, not pegs, are portrayed onscreen
